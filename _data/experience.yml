    Built a <mark>statically typed, compiled language</mark> called <mark>simpPRU</mark> for TI's am335x PRU(programmable real time unit). 
    Used <mark>bison, flex</mark> to create parser and lexer, then converted code down to C, rather than ASM, because pru-gcc toolchain is quite mature.
    
    simpPRU has a syntax similar to python, thus making it easier for a beginner to start coding for the <mark>PRU</mark>, which usually involves in depth knowledge of Linux API's and low level register manipulation. 
    
    Extensively used <mark>Linux Kernel's Remoteproc framework</mark>
    Distributed it through <mark>Debian packages</mark>, and setup CI/CD using <mark>docker and github actions</mark> to automate build and release process.
